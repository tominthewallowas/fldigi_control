Modify fldigi_control.py to incorporate use of day of the week and utc time from database to
control radio. This will alleviate the need for the many crontab entries related to each
radio schedule and the clumsy program names used by the crontab.

I anticipate a cron job that will run periodically, perhaps every minute or at the 29th
and 59th minute of each hour and launch fldigi_control.py.

fldigi_control.py will then collect the utc time and extract the day of the week and the
time (hour and minute) and then select from the sqlite3 database table programs based
on those parameters.

If row is returned then fldigi_control will start the pyfldigi processes to set up the
radio appropriately.

Note that only one set of data from the one row will be used. So if there are two rows with
the same criteria, one of the rows will be discarded.
