After incorporating UTC Day and Time into fldigi_control it's now time to integrate that into fldigi_control_maintenance.

Add a combo box that is preloaded from a list that includes Day of Week as "Sun, Mon, etc."

Add a time field for entering the Utc Time.

Future enhancements:

I would also like to have a way to correct for Daylight Savings Time depending on the each program. That is some programs observe a change to DST from to ST and some don't.

I would also like to create a report based on the UTC Time and Day converted to local time and observant of DST.

New schema used by fldigi_control:
CREATE TABLE programs_new(
  Id INT,
  Program TEXT,
  Station TEXT,
  StationFrequency TEXT,
  Modulation TEXT,
  Bandwidth TEXT,
  Modem TEXT,
  CenterFrequency TEXT,
  Active TEXT,
  Notes TEXT,
  Day text, <-- Add to gui
  UtcTime text <-- Add to gui
); 

Schema used by fldigi_control_maintenance:
CREATE TABLE programs (
        Id integer primary key,
        Program Text default "",
        Station Text default "",
        StationFrequency Text default "",
        Modulation Text default "",
        Bandwidth Text default "",
        Modem Text default "",
        CenterFrequency Text default "",
        Active Text default "Y",
        Notes Text default ""
 );

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "programs"(
  Id INTEGER primary key autoincrement,
  Program TEXT,
  Station TEXT,
  StationFrequency TEXT,
  Modulation TEXT,
  Bandwidth TEXT,
  Modem TEXT,
  CenterFrequency TEXT,
  Active TEXT,
  Notes TEXT,
  Day text,
  UtcTime text);
